## Introduction

The aim of this project is to create a dataset of painters from sources such as WikiArt and Art500k, combining features, substituting missing data of painters via the Wikipedia API and make corrections/additions both automated and manually. After finding mappings between painters in the two sources + Wikidata, the dataset includes around ***10000 painters*** with many attributes.

Currently, the dataset includes ***29 attributes***:
- Biography data: Nationality/citizenship, name, birth and death years and places, gender
- Artistic style data
- Locations of activity (sometimes with years)
- Occupations (e.g. painter, sculptor, litographer, etc.)
- Influences: on painters, and from painters, pupils, teachers
- Friends, coworkers (limited data)
- Quantities of paintings, in styles, etc.

The dataset is intended to be used for various purposes, including data analysis, machine learning, and visualization projects.<br>
One long-term goal would be to create a JSON file that contains all combined hierarchically. A level in the structure could be art movement, inside it, are artists with some base bio data, an even lower layer could be the paintings of the painter (even better could be eras of painters in their substructure, and inside them the paintings).

We have created multiple networks of painters (based on being at the same places at the same time + nationality, additionally style similarity, or who influenced whom networks) in another project (see: [ArtProject](https://github.com/me9hanics/ArtProject/)). A network of styles and movements were also created.

### Resulting dataset/file

Download version *1.0.1* as a *CSV* file [**here**](https://github.com/me9hanics/PainterPalette/releases/download/v1.0.1/PainterPalette.csv)

**Soon Excel file format included too**

In any case, the final ("compiled") dataset is stored in the *artists.csv* file (raw file here: [raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/me9hanics/PainterPalette/main/datasets/artists.csv), often this is better import / look at as it doesn't have the commit ID in the URL so this gives back always the freshest version).

### Work in progress:
- Find the aliases of painters in Art500k dataset (one painter, multiple instances with different names e.g., Rembrandt and Rembrandt van Rijn); currently the methods are being developed and discussed (the two highest candidate methods are finding aliases through Wikipedia and Wikidata, and using a word embedding to find the very similar names).
- Broader combination of datasets (handle aliases, add more painters to the final dataset)


## Some visualizations using the dataset

## Quick Start

You can use the dataset by importing it in your Python environment (using something like Pandas):

```python
import pandas as pd

url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/me9hanics/PainterPalette/main/datasets/artists.csv"
artists = pd.read_csv(url)
artists
```

The artists.csv file contains all information about painters, each row representing a painter, columns representing an attribute. An example of a few painters from the dataset:

Capital first letter means the attribute is collected from Art500k paintings data, non-capital means the attribute is collected from WikiArt or Wikidata.

### Attributes explained

- Nationality and citizenship: The first one is gathered from Art500k, the second one is from fetching Wikidata.
- Styles and movements: Paintings have an artistic style, and painters have (mostly one) artistic movement. In `movement`, this most commonly associated movement with the painter is stored, this is from WikiArt paintings, painters in that dataset only have one movement assigned to them. Styles are counted and stored in `styles`, `styles_extended`, `StylesCount`, `StylesYears` (and `Art500k_Movements`) store information on the quantity of paintings painted by this painter, and the periods in which he painted them.
- WikiArt pictures count: how many paintings the painter has in the WikiArt dataset.
- First and last year: The earliest year contained in the Art500k dataset when the painter had a painting with this year in the date column + same with last year.
- Locations: Places where the painter lived or worked, and the years when he was there. The painter's exhibited paintings locations are also stored under `PaintingsExhibitedAt` and `PaintingsExhibitedAtCount`.
- Influences, teachers, friends, coworkers: The names in these cells are artists, so e.g. which painters the painter was influenced by (this is very sparse data)
- Others: mostly bio data, such as birth.

## Examples
Here are some examples of using the code to work with the dataset:

- Filter Renaissance painters:
```python
display(artists[artists['styles'].str.contains('Renaissance')])
```

- Get Monet's number of paintings per style (those available on WikiArt), sorted by number of paintings:

<div class="cell code">

``` python
import pandas as pd

style_counts = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/me9hanics/PainterPalette/main/datasets/wikiart_artists_styles_grouped.csv')
display(style_counts[style_counts['artist']=="Claude Monet"].sort_values(by='count', ascending=False))
```

</div>


<div class="output execute_result">

              style        artist       movement  count
      Impressionism  Claude Monet  Impressionism   1341
            Realism  Claude Monet  Impressionism     12
            Unknown  Claude Monet  Impressionism     12
        Academicism  Claude Monet  Impressionism      1
           Japonism  Claude Monet  Impressionism      1

</div>
or alternatively, you could use the artists.csv file and group painters and styles together.
